**Akihabara** is a decentralized visual intelligence network built for the next generation of AI-native creators. It empowers artists, storytellers, and game studios to generate continuously evolving 2D manga-style worlds directly on-chain. Unlike traditional image models that focus on single-frame beauty, Akihabara focuses on sequence and narrative continuity— every panel, character and scene can remember its own past.
“From sketch to story, from story to world — Akihabara turns AI art into visual memory.”
